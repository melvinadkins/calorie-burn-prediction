In this project, I built a regression model using CatBoost to predict the number of calories burned during a workout. CatBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost were used for model selection. I applied hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering to the second best performing model, CatBoost, achieving an RMSLE score of 0.06302 on the submission data and an RMSLE of 0.0587 of my test set. CatBoost was selected because it supports GPU acceleration, enabling faster tuning and training. The final result is an interactive web app powered by Streamlit that provides project background and model prediction for user inputs.

## 🧠 Model Performance
The final model has a mean average error of 2, meaning that on average, the prediction is within 2 calories of the actual calories burned. Additionally, the learning curves indicate that the model generalizes well. Improvements to this model may include
further hyperparameter tuning and/or ensemble model for prediction.

## 🌐 Web App
You can interact with the model using the Streamlit app. Users can input information about their workout and predict the number of calories burned.
